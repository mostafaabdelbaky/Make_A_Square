What is Square Game:



Our project is more like a game called “Tetris”, it’s about putting pieces falling out of the top together at the bottom to form a straight line and then the straight line vanishes.our project is a program that is supposed to take a set of pieces and use them to form a 4x4 square without any gaps, it should automatically rotate or flip the pieces or keep them on their original state to form that perfect 4x4 square.



- run project and try this Examples:

1- L=2, J=2

2- L=2, I=2

3- L=2, O=2

4- I=2, J=2

5- L=2, Z=2

6- S=2, J=2

7- L=1, J=1, I=1, Z=1

8- L=2, I=2, O=1

9- L=4

10- O=4

11- I=4

12- J=4
